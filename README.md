Synchronous motors are synchronous machines used to convert electrical power to mechanical power.The goal of this project is implement a sensorless controller for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).

The project consists of four parts:
1- PMSM modeling.
2- Vector controller for PMSM.
3- Sensorless controller based on adaptive observer.
4- Sensorless controller based on DREM adaptive observer.

Each part makes a base for the next one, so we recommend the user to follow them in order.
